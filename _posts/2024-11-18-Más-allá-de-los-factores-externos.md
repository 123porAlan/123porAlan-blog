## The Common Focus on the External

On the path of life, it is common to observe how most people focus their attention on external factors to explain their circumstances. From morning traffic to job opportunities, there is a tendency to attribute events to chance or to forces beyond our control. However, this perspective can cloud the understanding that, on many occasions, it is we ourselves who, consciously or unconsciously, shape our own destiny.

## Two Types of Mindsets

When meeting someone, we usually distinguish between two fundamental types of people. On one hand, there are those who, despite facing adversity, seek to move forward without victimizing themselves. They adopt a resilient mindset, similar to the Japanese concept of _gambaru_. This term goes beyond simply trying; it implies an unwavering dedication until reaching the final goal. _Gambaru_ means giving it your all, without excuses or rest, until you have nothing left to offer. It is a philosophy of life that values perseverance and absolute commitment.

## The Trap of Victimization

On the other hand, there are people who choose to victimize themselves in the face of every obstacle. These individuals tend to adopt a mediocre mindset, avoiding personal responsibility and denying their own mistakes. Carl Jung expressed it clearly: "People could learn from their mistakes if they weren't so busy denying them." This denial not only prevents personal growth but also creates barriers to establishing meaningful relationships and surrounding oneself with positive influences.

From a philosophical perspective, this duality reflects the eternal struggle between determinism and free will. While some recognize their ability to influence their own destiny, others feel trapped by external circumstances. The way we choose to interpret and respond to life's events defines our essence and our path.

## What Do You Choose?

In conclusion, the mindset we adopt is a crucial factor that determines our success and well-being. Surrounding ourselves with people who value personal responsibility and perseverance can inspire us to develop a stronger and more resilient mindset. In the end, true transformation begins from within, and recognizing our own power to change is the first step toward a fuller and more meaningful life.
