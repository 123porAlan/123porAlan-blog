# **The Life Cycle of a Bug: Stages, Roles, and Best Practices**

The life cycle of a bug is the structured process a defect follows from its detection to its final resolution. Each stage involves specific actions and clearly defined roles to ensure efficient management and an effective solution. Below, I detail each phase in greater depth, including best practices and alternative flows.

---

## **1. New (New)**

**Responsible**: Tester or QA Engineer  
**Description**:  
The tester identifies unexpected or inconsistent behavior during test execution (manual or automated) and reports it in the bug tracking system.

**Key Actions**:  
âœ” **Detailed documentation**:

- Exact steps to reproduce the defect.
- Test environment (browser, OS, software version, etc.).
- **Expected** behavior vs. **actual behavior**.
- Screenshots, logs, or videos if relevant.

âœ” **Bug classification**:

- **Priority** (Urgent, High, Medium, Low): Impact on the business or user.
- **Severity** (Critical, Major, Medium, Minor): Degree to which the system is affected.

âœ” **Initial assignment**:

- The bug is logged as "New" and assigned to the development lead or project manager for review.

---

## **2. Assigned (Assigned)**

**Responsible**: Development Lead or Project Manager  
**Description**:  
The bug is evaluated to determine its validity and assigned to the corresponding developer.

**Key Actions**:  
âœ” **Initial validation**:

- Confirm if the bug is **reproducible** and not duplicated.
- Verify if it is a real defect or a misunderstanding (e.g., configuration error).

âœ” **Possible decisions**:

- **Accept**: Assign to the developer for correction.
- **Reject**: If it is not a valid bug (e.g., expected behavior, user error).
- **Defer**: If it is not critical and will be addressed in a future iteration.

---

## **3. Active (Active / In Progress)**

**Responsible**: Developer  
**Description**:  
The developer investigates and corrects the defect.

**Key Actions**:  
âœ” **Root cause analysis**:

- Review the code, logs, and related flows.
- Identify if the error is from the development itself, integration, or an external component.

âœ” **Solution development**:

- Implement the fix and test it locally.
- Ensure it does not introduce new defects (unit tests).

âœ” **Status update**:

- Document the changes made in the tracking system.

---

## **4. Fixed (Fixed / Resolved)**

**Responsible**: Developer  
**Description**:  
The developer confirms the bug has been corrected and sends it for verification.

**Key Actions**:  
âœ” **Push changes to the repository**:

- Make a commit with a clear description (e.g., "Fix #123: Correction of tax calculation error").
- Merge into the corresponding branch (develop, main, etc.).

âœ” **Mark as "Fixed" in the system**:

- Indicate the version where the fix was applied.
- Provide additional details if the tester needs to validate something specific.

---

## **5. Verified (Verified / Closed)**

**Responsible**: Tester  
**Description**:  
The QA verifies that the fix is effective and does not cause regressions.

**Key Actions**:  
âœ” **Regression testing**:

- Validate the original bug scenario.
- Ensure that related functionalities are not affected.

âœ” **Possible outcomes**:

- **Success**: The bug moves to "Closed" status.
- **Failure**: It is reopened and returned to "Active" with detailed comments.

---

## **6. Closed (Closed)**

**Responsible**: Tester or QA Lead  
**Description**:  
The bug is permanently closed upon confirming its resolution.

**Key Actions**:  
âœ” **Final documentation**:

- Log evidence of the successful test.
- Update project quality reports.

âœ” **Archiving**:

- The bug remains as a reference for future audits or analysis.

---

## **7. Rejected (Rejected)**

**Responsible**: Development Lead or QA Manager  
**Description**:  
The bug is discarded for not being valid (duplicate, not reproducible, user error, etc.).

**Key Actions**:  
âœ” **Clear justification**:

- Example: "Not a defect, the behavior is as expected per requirement X."

âœ” **Communication with the tester**:

- If the bug was misinterpreted, the scenario is clarified to avoid similar reports.

---

## **Alternative Flows and Considerations**

ðŸ”„ **Reopening a Bug**

- If the fix does not work, the bug returns to **"Active"** with detailed observations.
- If the same defect is found in another area, a **new report** is created and linked to the original one.

âš  **Duplicate or Invalid Bugs**

- They are marked as **"Rejected"** or **"Duplicate"** and linked to the main bug.

ðŸ›  **Best Practices** âœ” **Constant communication** between Devs and QA to avoid misunderstandings.  
âœ” **Tracking with tools** like Jira, Azure DevOps, or Bugzilla to maintain traceability.  
âœ” **Retrospectives** to analyze recurring bugs and improve processes.

---

**Conclusion** A well-managed bug life cycle improves software quality, optimizes the team's time, and facilitates the delivery of more stable products. The key lies in **clear documentation**, **collaboration between roles**, and the **use of appropriate tools**.
