    <h3>The Essentials for Surviving with GIT</h3>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>When I started college, the professors in my department suggested we take the preparatory course for the major. I, like any young and inexperienced person, thought it was a fabulous idea: a course that would teach us the basics before the class that would actually grade us. I proceeded to take said prep course. The final step? We had to fork a project and then modify it to, in the end, send a pull request. What happened in my case? I couldn’t do it.</p>

<p>It was then that I researched different resources on my own. Today I want to share what I consider the most essential and necessary things to survive both the start of college and the first days of work, or at least to have a clue about what’s going on.</p>

<p><strong>1. Installing Git (No Fear)</strong></p>

<p>First things first: you need to have Git installed. If you use Windows, download the installer from <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a>. On Mac, open the terminal and type:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew <span class="nb">install </span>git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On Linux, the classic:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get <span class="nb">install </span>git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you use the good distro (Fedora)—which, by the way, we’ll talk about in the next post, that’s already in the works.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nb">install </span>git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Done? Let’s continue.</p>

<p><strong>2. Configure your identity (so you’re not “unknown”)</strong></p>

<p>Git wants to know who you are. This way your changes don’t show up as “mysterious user”. Just put this in the terminal (change the data to your own):</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.name <span class="s2">"Your Name"</span>
git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.email <span class="s2">"you@email.com"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Want to see how it looks? Use:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config <span class="nt">--list</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>3. Initialize your repository (the starting point)</strong></p>

<p>Go to your project folder and run:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git init
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This creates the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> folder where Git saves all your project’s configuration.</p>

<p><strong>4. Add your files and make your first commit</strong></p>

<p>To tell Git which files you want to save, use:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The dot means “all files”. If you only want one, put the name instead of just the dot.</p>

<p>Now, save that moment with a commit:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"First commit"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>5. Connect to a remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)</strong></p>

<p>You already have your repo on GitHub (or whichever one you use). Copy the URL and link it like this:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git remote add origin <span class="o">[</span>https://github.com/your-user/your-repo.git]<span class="o">(</span>https://github.com/your-user/your-repo.git<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>6. Upload your project (push)</strong></p>

<p>Time to send everything to the cloud:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push <span class="nt">-u</span> origin main
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or if your main branch is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push <span class="nt">-u</span> origin master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-u</code> is so that next time you only have to type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code> and Git already knows where.</p>

<p><strong>7. Download changes (pull)</strong></p>

<p>Working in a team or from multiple computers? Before starting, it’s always a good idea to bring in the latest changes from your teammates:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git pull
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This way you avoid surprises.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-do-branches-work-in-git">How do branches work in Git?</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever heard phrases like “make a branch for that new feature” or “don’t work directly on main”, but you have no idea what that’s about, I’ll tell you here. In fact, it’s easier than it looks.</p>

<p><strong>What are branches for?</strong></p>

<p>Branches in Git are like parallel timelines where you can work on new ideas, fix bugs, or experiment, without affecting the main code. Imagine your project is a tree: the main branch (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>) is the trunk, and each new branch is a little twig where you can make changes without fear of breaking everything.</p>

<p>This is useful because it allows you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test new things without risking the entire project.</li>
  <li>Work on several tasks at the same time (e.g., one branch for a new feature and another to fix a bug).</li>
  <li>Collaborate with other people without overwriting each other’s changes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to create a branch?</strong></p>

<p>Creating a branch is as easy as typing:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git branch your-branch-name
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the most common way is to create it and switch to it at the same time:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout <span class="nt">-b</span> your-branch-name
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, everything you do will be saved in that branch, not in the main one.</p>

<p><strong>How to move between branches?</strong></p>

<p>To switch branches, just use:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout your-branch-name
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or, if you use a modern version of Git, you can use:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git switch your-branch-name
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This way you can jump between different lines of work without losing anything.</p>

<p><strong>How to see the branches you have?</strong></p>

<p>To see all the branches in your project:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git branch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The branch you are currently on will appear with an asterisk.</p>

<hr />

<p>See? Branches aren’t that difficult. They are your best friend for working in an organized way and without fear of breaking anything.
In the next section, I’ll tell you how to merge branches and what to do if Git tells you there are conflicts.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-to-merge-and-resolve-conflicts">How to merge and resolve conflicts?</h2>

<p>The time has come to join paths. When you work with branches, sooner or later you’ll want to join the changes from one branch with another. This is called a <strong>merge</strong>. But, as in any story worth telling, sometimes there are clashes and the dreaded <strong>conflicts</strong> appear. Here’s how to face them without losing your cool.</p>

<p><strong>What is a merge?</strong></p>

<p>Doing a merge in Git is basically saying: “I want the changes from this branch to be mixed with those of another.” Usually, the most common thing is to merge your working branch into the main branch (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>).</p>

<p><strong>How to do a merge?</strong></p>

<p>Suppose you have a branch called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feature-x</code> and you want to merge it into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>. Do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Switch to the branch where you want to join the changes (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>):</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout main
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the merge:</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git merge feature-x
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If all goes well, Git will mix the changes automatically, and that’s it.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-if-there-are-conflicts">What happens if there are conflicts?</h3>

<p>Sometimes, Git can’t decide on its own how to join the changes because two branches modified the same part of a file. That is a <strong>conflict</strong>.</p>

<p>When this happens, Git notifies you and marks the conflicting files. Inside those files, you will see something like this:</p>

<p>Your job is to choose which part to keep, or even combine both. Delete the markers (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=======</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>) and leave the final result as you wish.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-solve-the-conflict">How do I solve the conflict?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the conflicting file and edit it until it’s correct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Save the changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mark the conflict as resolved:</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add name-of-the-file
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finish the merge with a commit (if Git doesn’t do it on its own):</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git commit
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Done! You’ve resolved the conflict and your branches are merged.</p>

<hr />

<p>Conflicts might seem difficult at first, but with practice, they become part of the daily routine. The important thing is to read calmly, understand what changed, and decide which version you want to keep. Now you are ready to work with Git. Good luck!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.:</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-want-to-go-back-to-a-previous-commit">What if I want to go back to a previous commit?</h2>

<p>Sometimes, after several changes, you realize something went wrong and you want to go back to a previous version of your project. Don’t worry, Git has you covered there too.</p>

<p>First, to see the commit history, use:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git log <span class="nt">--oneline</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will show you a list of commits with their identifiers (that weird code at the beginning of each line).</p>

<p>If you just want to see what your project was like at a previous commit (without losing anything), you can temporarily move with:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout commit-id
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But if you want to reset your branch to that point (be careful, this <em>does</em> change history!), you can use:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git reset <span class="nt">--hard</span> commit-id
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or if you just want to undo the last changes but save them for later, use:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git reset <span class="nt">--soft</span> commit-id
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you just want to undo the last commit but leave the files as they were, you can do:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git reset <span class="nt">--soft</span> HEAD~1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remember: before doing a reset, make sure you don’t have important changes un-backed-up, because you could lose them.</p>

<p>And that’s it! Now you can time-travel with Git and save yourself from any disaster.</p>
